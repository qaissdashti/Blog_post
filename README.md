<b> My Questions </b>
After looking into the data, and trying to understand what is collected and how it can be used to better viausal the data,
below are a few question i came up with. The answer should provide some isnight.

1. What effect the prices of the hosts rental properties?
2. Does the area they are renting in effcets thes price? is it the number of reviews they got?
2. What are the different counts of properties and does the property type effect the price?
3. Does the cancolation policy play any role in the price? and is the review score rating baised?
4. Is the rental sector in Seatle seasonal? and when is the best time to rent?




<b>My findings</b>
I will summarise the finding here in section based on the topic:
Prices:
The highest three neighbourhoods are, Magnolia 177 USD, Queen Anne at 157 USD, and Downtown at 154 USD
Down town neighrbourhood has the highest prices as outliers, and second highest as of counts of rental properties.
The highest mean prices of the year at July at 151 USD. It is surley summer and tourest are in seattle. The lowest month is January which is after all the holidays at a mean price of 121 USD.
Also there is a correlation between a higher price and the rental property accomodatuin type, the more it accomodates the higher the price. Also 67% of the rentals are priced between 20 to 220 USD per night, with a mean if 127 USD.
If you had a boat to rent out, you can charge higher than most property type, you have a larger spread.

Property Type:
The Appartments and Houses are the main rental propotyies by far (45% and 44% respectivly). Aprtamnet and Houses are close from a price standpoint. Houses have a larger spread of prices in comparison with Appartments. 

Best Rental Dates:
The highest month for rental is July and the lowest is January. Also cancellation policy seems to play no effect on the rentals, but only on the Downtown area where they are strick with cancalellatiion and i it seems because downtown has a lot of places with higher priced rentals. The higher you are pricing your rental property the less flexible you are with cancellations. 

Review Scores:
One issue i feel that the data is baised is that the review score rating are shifted to the higher end of the rating, closer to 100% with a mean score of 94%. I feel this maybe baised because most of the data is rated high. There is also a clear relationship with higher review rates and higher prices. The less your ratings the less you charge.
